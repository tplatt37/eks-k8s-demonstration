# Demos - Observability

There are 3 major demo opportunities:

Prometheus metrics - show the CoreDNS, AWS LB Controller, Node, etc all produce Prometheus metrics
They will work with these in the lab.

CloudWatch / Container - Insights - low hanging fruit, because it's enabled already in the cluster.

X-Ray - A-new-startup has X-Ray enabled, so you can generate some activity and show that - IF desired.

If you do demo this, explain that the a-new-startup pod has the X-Ray Daemon running "sidecar" and listening on port :2000.
