# Using s3 to transfer files.

It's very easy to transfer files to and from s3 , assuming you have the aws cli installed.

For example, to copy coreks.zip to a bucket:
```
aws s3 cp coreks.zip s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
```

Want to copy the file FROM the bucket? Also easy:
```
aws s3 cp s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/coreks.zip . 
```

(The "." means "here")

It's that easy!  This is great for transferring files back and forth between your Cloud9 environment and your local machine.
