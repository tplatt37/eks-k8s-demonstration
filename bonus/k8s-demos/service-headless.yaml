# Headless Service: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services
#
# Setup xray as a daemonset, to be accessed as a Headless service (clusterIP:None)
# No load-balancing, no iptables rules. 
# The service name should resolve to all the endpoints (IPs of the pods.)
#
# k apply -f service-headless.yaml
# k get svc
#     NOTE: ClusterIP should be blank, it's a headless service
# k get endpoints
#   NOTE: This should display the Pod IPs.
#
# k run -it --rm debug --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=Never -- sh
#
# nslookup xray-service
#
# Should return a DNS record for every pod IP.

# Another killer use case for a Headless service is a statefulset database - where you want to explicitly choose which node you are connecting to (Primary vs Read Only, etc.)
